    tac
    po
    mar, padd
}

E - object part of a block (inside of it) separate __
The element name is separated from the block name with a double underscore

M - appearance, state or behaviour of a block or element
The modifier name is separated from the block or element name with double hypen
BLock and element are the shape
modifier are the styles

====mixes 
If we have an element that can be reused in any place again 
that when you can use mixes e.g a button. white and black variation

so for those buttons in the card, instead of making them a card__button we simply make them a block themselves
because it can be used outside of the card itself

in abutton for example you the padding can always be the same so it can be on the block
but the margins can be different in many context so the class should be on the modifier btn

button block
card__button element this could take the margins because it's used on in the card
card__button--primary this could take the bgc and colors

CSS Media Queries
The @media rule, introduced in CSS2, made it possible to define different style rules for different media types.
